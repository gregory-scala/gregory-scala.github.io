Welcome to my website! My name is Gregory Scala. I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. My research is at the intersection of Health Economics and Industrial Organization. I am particularly interested in how consumers value and how companies provide different benefits in health insurance.

I am on the Job Market in the AY 2024-2025.

Here are links to my **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FzZRKDUscJYgGrcqA2TyNWtHwTJdse8D/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}** and my **[Job Market Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6wWJlCT6lG0K42SUhnOJmTvzPtuqsQ4/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}**.
