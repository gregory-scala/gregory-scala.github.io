## Working Papers
- **[Do Racial and Ethnic Minorities Benefit from Supplemental Benefits in Medicare Advantage?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6wWJlCT6lG0K42SUhnOJmTvzPtuqsQ4/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}**  (Job Market Paper)
  <br/>
  *Abstract:* This paper analyzes different factors contributing to the increasing enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Medicare Advantage plans as opposed to Traditional Fee for Service Medicare (Traditional Medicare; TM). Previous work has identified this pattern, but the mechanisms driving this enrollment gap are largely unknown. I develop a model where Medicare beneficiaries observe the prices and other supplemental benefits offered by different Medicare Advantage plans to examine the attributes of these plans that are popular among different racial and ethnic groups. I find the average gain in welfare from dental coverage, eyewear coverage, and hearing aid coverage is $16.95 per Hispanic Medicare Advantage beneficiary, $11.79 per Non-Hispanic Black Medicare Advantage beneficiary, while only $0.60 per Medicare beneficiary for other races. These results highlight the value of supplemental benefits, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities, especially as policymakers are considering adding dental, vision, and hearing coverage to Traditional Medicare.

## Works in Progress
- **Did the Medicare Advantage Double Bonus Program increase Supplemental Benefit Offerings in Medicare Advantage plans?**
  <br/><br/>
  *Abstract:* The Medicare Advantage Quality Bonus Program provides additional payments to high-quality Medicare Advantage plans in select counties. I develop a Difference-in-Difference model to compare the characteristics of plans in counties eligible for double quality bonuses compared to those that are not. Preliminary results do not provide evidence that plans eligible for additional quality bonuses are more likely to offer dental, eyewear, or hearing aid coverage.
