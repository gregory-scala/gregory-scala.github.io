## Working Papers
- **[Do Racial and Ethnic Minorities Benefit from Supplemental Benefits in Medicare Advantage?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6wWJlCT6lG0K42SUhnOJmTvzPtuqsQ4/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}**  (Job Market Paper)
  <br/><br/>
  *Abstract:* This paper analyzes different factors contributing to the increasing enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Medicare Advantage plans as opposed to Traditional Fee for Service Medicare (Traditional Medicare; TM). Previous work has identified this pattern, but the mechanisms driving this enrollment gap are largely unknown. I develop a model where Medicare beneficiaries observe the prices and other supplemental benefits offered by different Medicare Advantage plans to examine the attributes of these plans that are popular among different racial and ethnic groups. I find the average gain in welfare from dental coverage, eyewear coverage, and hearing aid coverage is $16.95 per Hispanic Medicare Advantage beneficiary, $11.79 per Non-Hispanic Black Medicare Advantage beneficiary, while only $0.60 per Medicare beneficiary for other races. These results highlight the value of supplemental benefits, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities, especially as policymakers are considering adding dental, vision, and hearing coverage to Traditional Medicare.

  - **Did Double Bonuses Increase Benefits in Medicare Advantage Plans?** (Draft Forthcoming)
  <br/><br/>
  *Abstract:* The Medicare Advantage Quality Bonus Program (QBP) was designed to incentivize health insurance providers to provide high-quality Medicare Advantage plans. One of the provisions of the QBP is that it provides additional payments to high-quality Medicare Advantage plans in select counties. However, previous work does not show evidence that either double bonuses, or the QBP in general, are effective at increasing plan quality. While double bonuses may not be effective at increasing plan quality, I find evidence that double bonuses increase the supplemental benefits plans provide and decrease monthly premiums and copayments in affected counties. Policy makers considering eliminating double bonuses should consider the unintended effects that eliminating these incentive payments would have on beneficiaries.
