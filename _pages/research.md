## Working Papers
- **Do Racial and Ethnic Minorities Benefit from Supplemental Benefits in Medicare Advantage?**  (Job Market Paper)
  (Preliminary draft available upon request)
  <br/><br/>
  *Abstract* This paper analyzes different factors that lead to the increasing enrollment of racial
and ethnic minorities in Medicare Advantage plans as opposed to Traditional Fee for
Service Medicare (Traditional Medicare; TM). Previous work has identified this patter,
but the mechanism leading to this enrollment gap is largely unknown. I develop a model
where Medicare Beneficiaries observe prices and other supplemental benefits offered to
analyze the attributes of Medicare Advantage plans that are popular among different
racial and ethnic groups. I find that Hispanics and Non-Hispanic Blacks benefit more
from dental coverage and hearing aid coverage than other races. These results highlight
the value of supplemental benefits, particularly among disadvantaged groups, especially
as policy makers are considering adding supplemental benefits to Traditional Medicare.
