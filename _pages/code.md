Here I present code from some of my research projects during my doctoral studies. 

## [Do Racial and Ethnic Minorities Benefit From Supplemental Benefits in Medicare Advantage?](https://github.com/gregory-scala/welfare_ma){:target="_blank"} 
In this project, I develop and estimate demand model where consumers select either a Medicare Advantage plan, based on their demographic characteristics and the features of avaliable Medicare Advantage plans in their county. I integrate individual-level data and plan level-data, and apply numerical optimization tecnhiques to conduct Maximum Likelihood Estimation. *Note, this project does not contain data to reproduce the code*

## [Did the Medicare Advantage Double Bonus Program increase Supplemental Benefit Offerings in Medicare Advantage plans?](https://github.com/gregory-scala/did_project){:target="_blank"} 
In this project, I conduct Difference-in-Difference estimation to analyze the effect of double quality bonuses in select counties for Medicare Advantage plans. I also obtain county-level characteristics from ACS using the United States Census Bureau API.
